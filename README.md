# Compression-Detection

The goal of this project is to be able to detect network compression between two parties on both the client and server implementation and the standalone implementation of this project. This project is broken up into two parts: the first part consists of a client and server applications, where you would need two vms to run this program and see it communicate with each other to report if there is "compression" detected. In the other part of the project, we have a standalone application that will send the UDP and TCP packets without any cooperation from a server.
